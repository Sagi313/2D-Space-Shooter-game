# 2D-Space-Shooter-game
Used Python and pygame to make this one. It's my first project using python. Made it 5 years ago

To start the game, open the Space_battle.py file. 
Make sure you have python and pygame installed.
There is also a 1vs1 game mode inside with instructions on how to play!

Enjoy :)
